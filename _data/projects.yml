      FIRAbot and ComSocBot are server management 'bots for the communication client Discord. FIRAbot was written in
      JavaScript using Discord.js and ComSocBot is written in C# using DSharpPlus. Both applications required me to
      learn a new API and allowed me to gain a deeper insight into how APIs work and the work that goes into using them.

# Snake

      This was a small project I created to help me get a better understanding of how Graphics in C# work, as well as
      attempt to help my classmates in understanding the .NET DoubleBuffered property.

# C4
- project: C4 - Multiplayer Connect 4 [VB]
  role: Developer

      This was my first time pair-programming, and I think it went particularly well. While Noah handled a large amount
      of the server-side operation (and created a basic Connect4 application because our teacher told us we had to),
      I focused on the client-side of the application (C4). We developed a protocol for sharing game state data, then
      implemented it in our respective languages. This was also my first time using NewtonSoft's JSON library, which
      proved to be a highly effective tool.

# T3
- project: T3 - Noughts and Crosses with Replay Abilities [VB]
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: 2017

  description: >
      My second VB project was a version of the traditional children's game Tic Tac Toe (-> TTT -> T3). I wanted to
      experiment with file handling and decided that a useful feature to do this with would be the ability to replay
      a previous game to show how players had improved. I also tinkered with .NET's integrations with Windows, such as
      drag and drop files and file associations. It was also through this application that I first began to understand
      OOP techniques.
